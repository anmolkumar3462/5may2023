            <center><img src="./img/1.png" alt=""></center>
            <p>Is the Congress deluded by its own propaganda, internal surveys and rhetorical claims of a 130-plus tally in the upcoming elections? Can it decisively wrest power from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) whose challenge is weakened by anti-incumbency and the lack of a pan-Karnataka face after BS Yediyurappa’s semi-retirement? More importantly, will the outcome be decisive the way it was in 2013? Or will the electorate throw up a fractured verdict like in 2018?</p>

            <center><img src="./img/3.png" alt=""></center>
            <p>With the rise of China as a global economic and military super-power inevitable this decade, India will be the odd man out in the SCO and the BRICS as virtually all the members of these groupings are recipients of copious infrastructure aid from Beijing in the name of Belt-Road Initiative (BRI). Brazil is still to join the BRI but has already received some USD 66 billion in infrastructure investment from China with its Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cozying up to President Xi Jinping in Beijing last month.</p>

            <center><img src="./img/5.png" alt=""></center>
            <p>On Wednesday, thousands of tribals took out a march in the state’s 10 hill districts, where most of the tribal population resides, opposing a proposal to grant scheduled tribe (ST) status to the Meitei community, which comprises around 53% of Manipur’s population and is based mainly in the Imphal Valley.</p>
            <p>The All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM), Manipur’s most influential student body, alleges that clashes started after some miscreants burned a portion of the Anglo-Kuki War Memorial gate at Churachandpur. ATSUM office bearers claim the march ended peacefully, but that when the war memorial was burnt, it aggravated the situation that led to clashes between Meiteis and other tribals. Several properties and vehicles of Meiteis were targeted.</p>

            <p>Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday dismissed the criticism of party chief Uddhav Thackeray in Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar's autobiography as “wrong information.” Pawar, in his revised autobiography ‘Lok Majhe Sangati’, questioned Thackeray's absence from the chief minister's office during the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), an issue often raised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He wrote it was difficult to fathom why Thackeray as chief minister chose to visit the state secretariat only twice during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

            <center><img src="./img/7.png" alt=""></center>
            <p>KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Shikhar Dhawan, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik… and of course Rohit Sharma. Captaincy in Indian cricket has become a round of musical chairs ever since Virat Kohli stepped down. Mostly because Rohit has time and again been either rested or gotten injured. After Rohit was appointed India's all-formats captain in January of 2022, he missed the ODI series in South Africa, the rescheduled fifth Test against England, and the Test series in Bangladesh. In his absence, almost everyone had a go, albeit without much success. Under Rahul, India were whitewashed 0-3 in South Africa, and when he pulled his hamstring making way for Pant to take over, the T20Is at home against the same opponents finished 1-1.</p>

            <p>Team India's star spinner Kuldeep Yadav has had an eventful career so far – both, with the national team as well as in the Indian Premier League. Kuldeep was one of Team India's mainstays until the 2019 World Cup before he was dropped from the side; however, he made an impressive return across all formats last year, and remains a key part of the side – particularly in the limited overs. In the IPL, Kuldeep enjoyed some of his best years with the Kolkata Knight Riders before a series of inconsistent performances shortened his game time and his eventual unceremonious release from the franchise before the 2022 edition.</p>
